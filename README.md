# AWS Transit VPC
A solution for creating a transit VPC with Cisco CSR instances. These templates rely on the following AWS Marketplace listings:
BYOL
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00NF48FI2

License Included
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00OCG4OAA

## OS/Python Environment Setup
```bash
sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
sudo yum update -y
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH'
sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

## Building Lambda Package
```bash
cd deployment
./build-s3-dist.sh source-bucket-base-name
```
source-bucket-base-name should be the base name for the S3 bucket location where the template will source the Lambda code from.
The template will append '-[region_name]' to this value.
For example: ./build-s3-dist.sh solutions
The template will then expect the source code to be located in the solutions-[region_name] bucket

## CF template and Lambda function
Located in deployment/dist
